## 📖 About Us
We are the Genesis Block of Hong Kong and our mission is to build a Bitcoin school where students learn about the history of money and monetary policy, and develop the practical skills around how to use Bitcoin. We aim to provide students with a comprehensive understanding of how Bitcoin is revolutionizing the world as we know it.

Our program includes hands-on activities that allow students to build their own Bitcoin projects using LNbits and BTCPay Server, run a Bitcoin node on Umbrel, set up both Lightning and on-chain wallets, and learn how to send, receive, and verify Bitcoin transactions. With the right tools, we envision a micro circular economy growing at our school with the intention of equipping students with the skills necessary to participate in the larger Bitcoin ecosystem.

Overall, this project represents an exciting new initiative that offers students the opportunity to learn about Bitcoin and take part in this growing industry. The curriculum is designed to be engaging, practical, and forward-thinking, helping students to become the problem solvers of tomorrow. The following are our initiatives for the coming year:

Deliver the My First Bitcoin Diploma Program to 50+ students.

Promote Bitcoin usage within our extra-curricular activities program.

Use Bitcoin for remittance payments to the Philippines using Pouch.

Develop a STEM-focused Bitcoin program.

Provide Bitcoin workshops to staff members.

Your consideration and kindness towards our project is most appreciated. Bitcoin has one of the most robust and passionate communities that continuously lifts each other up. We're grateful and look forward to working with Bitcoiners across the world.
